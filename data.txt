The Eiffel Tower is one of the most recognizable structures in the world. Located in Paris, France, it was designed by Gustave Eiffel and completed in 1889 as part of the Exposition Universelle, a worldâ€™s fair held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. The tower stands 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall and was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in New York City in 1930.

Initially, many Parisians disliked the tower, calling it an eyesore, but over time, it became a global cultural icon of France. Today, the Eiffel Tower attracts millions of visitors every year and is one of the most-visited paid monuments in the world.

The tower consists of three levels accessible to the public, with restaurants and observation decks offering panoramic views of Paris. At night, the Eiffel Tower is illuminated with thousands of lights, creating a spectacular display that can be seen across the city.
